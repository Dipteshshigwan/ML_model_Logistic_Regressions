Data Visualization and Exploration:
  Print 2 rows for sanity check to identify all the features present in the dataset and if the target matches with them.
  Comment on class imbalance with appropriate visualization method.
  Provide appropriate visualizations to get an insight about the dataset.
  Do the correlational analysis on the dataset. Provide a visualization for the same. Will this correlational analysis have an effect on feature selection that you will perform in the next step? Justify your answer.
  Any other visualization specific to the problem statement.

Data Pre-processing and cleaning
  Do the appropriate pre-processing of the data like identifying NULL or Missing Values if any, handling of outliers if present in the dataset, skewed data etc. Mention the pre-processing steps performed in the markdown cell. Explore a few latest data balancing tasks and its effect on model evaluation parameters.
  Apply appropriate feature engineering techniques for them. Apply the feature transformation techniques like Standardization, Normalization, etc. You are free to apply the appropriate transformations depending upon the structure and the complexity of your dataset. Explore a few techniques for identifying feature importance for your feature engineering task.

Model Building
  Split the dataset into training and test sets. Answers without justification will not be awarded marks.
  Explore k-fold cross validation.
  Build Model/s using - Logistic Regression
  Explore the need of regularization and incorporate few relevant techniques for the problem statement
